Very aware of other people’s feelings
Has a great memory for detail
personality type are introverted and tend to be quiet, they are keen observers and are focused on other people. Because they are so perceptive,  good at remembering details about other people. 
Those with this personality type are particularly well-tuned in to the emotions and feelings of others.
Because they are quiet, people sometimes misinterpret this as standoffish behavior. As Keirsey notes, this is far from the truth. understanding the emotions, they often struggle to express their own feelings. Rather than share their feelings, they may bottle them up, sometimes to the point that negative feelings toward other people can result. When dealing with life struggles such as illness or the death of a loved one, they may keep quiet about what they are experiencing in order to avoid burdening others with their troubles.

 small group of very close friends. While they may be quiet and reserved around people they don’t know well, they are more likely to “let loose” when they are around these close confidants. They place a high value on these close friendships and are always willing to support and care for the people they are close to.
